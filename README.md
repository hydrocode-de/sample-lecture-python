# Sample Lecture - Python

This is a template repository for creating lectures with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) and publish them
using [Notebook-Classroom](https://github.com/hydrocode-de/notebook-classroom). 

The best way to build your own is to [generate a new reepository using this as a template](https://github.com/hydrocode-de/sample-lecture-python/generate)
